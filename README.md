Press [SHIFT] when clicking on "ENTER", "MODE" or "GO TO" to generate a long key press.

The compiled binary just needs to be unpacked. No installation and no Python is needed. ASCOM driver https://bitbucket.org/cjdskunkworks/meadeautostar497 must be installed and off course you need to connect your #497 AutoSTAR with your computer.
